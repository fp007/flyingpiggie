<h2 id="软银与-WeWork"><a href="#软银与-WeWork" class="headerlink" title="软银与 WeWork"></a>软银与 WeWork</h2><p>2019年10月初，WeWork上市努力失败后，急需新的融资，创始人Adam Neumann承诺愿意出让公司控制权，一度与60家财务机构签署融资保密协议。软银当时持股1/3，有意向以新股和债权的形式，继续对WeWork注资，同时获得控制权。但是其他主流投资机构都不愿意参与。当年1月，软银投过一轮，当时估值470亿美元，报IPO的时候，大家质疑公司亏损太多，且与Neumann有太多关联交易，市场估值低于200亿，之后Neumann辞职，IPO取消，此时软银预计WeWork在2020年大约需要30亿美元的注资，而软银入股的估值可能会低于100亿。</p>
<p>孙正义派了个手下（Marcelo Claure）与WeWork的联合CEO，Artie Minson 和 Sebastian Gunningham，做公司Turnaround方案。与JP Morgan的债务重组谈判也在进行，JP并没有建议公司用自身的经营现金流还贷，而是通过向银行客户销售公司债券，说明公司的现金流并不足以还贷。如果当时IPO成功，可以从股票市场融资30亿，之后JP会同意给他60亿贷款额度。JP是WeWork的投资人、IPO的首席承销商、也管理了Neumann的私人账户。</p>
<p>2019年6月底，WeWork账面现金25亿，如果没有新的注资，公司评级会变成垃圾级，且只能撑到年底。Neumann具体的持股比例不清楚，他控制的We Holding持有WeWork大约1/3的股份和90%的投票权，JP以Neumann在We Holding中的股份作为抵押，6月底借给他3.8亿。最近他也在重组债务，他是CEO的时候，个人投资了很多物业然后租给公司，现在不做了，他在这些投资里的合伙人开始要考虑出售这些物业，因为可能今后不会拿到之前那样条款的租约。</p>
<p>10月15日，WeWork的债券大跌，2025年到期，票面利息7.875%，跌到0.79美元，到期收益率13.2%。这时WeWork只有两条路，一个是软银控股，一个是JP帮他发债，债券利率用新的债券抵偿（等于不用付息，但是复利）。正是这个新发债券的消息，让现有的债券条款显得不划算了，且债券发的越多，可以供抵偿的资产比例越低，新发债券的利率不能低于当前市场价格。</p>
<p>媒体开始关注WeWork和Neumann个人，有报道他在初创WeWork的时候，就和一个犹太教的传统宗教组织（Kabbalah）走的很近，通过这个组织来扩大社交圈，因为好些名人和有钱人也会去参加活动，比如Madonna和Ashton Kutcher。其中至少有两个成员是WeWork的早期投资人，好几个成员加入了WeWork做高管。组织的讲师定期会来公司演讲。Neumann本身就是犹太人，他老婆参加了好几个犹太教传统宗教组织，被老婆拉进Kabbalah，他在2012年说，就在参加该组织活动的时候，让他有了创建WeWork的想法。</p>
<p>10月22日，WeWork董事会选择了软银的注资，公司估值80亿，给Neumann一次性17亿，注资完成后，软银控股80%。软银将向WeWork的投资人和员工总共购买30亿美元的股份，其中Neumann最多可以出售9.7亿，帮助Neumann延期偿还欠JP的5亿美元个人贷款，同时还支付他1.85亿美元的咨询费，加在一起将近17亿，Neumann承诺再为公司工作4年，估计是因为关联交易太多，很多事情跟他有关。同时软银再要给WeWork提供50亿的融资，让公司能度过2020年。从2017年到2019年初，软银总共向WeWork按照240亿的估值，投入了90亿美元，加上这次承诺的投入，加在一起100多亿，而公司的估值只有80亿。据说，软银承诺给Neumann 5亿美元的贷款，是这个deal能谈成的关键，这笔贷款是用来偿还JP的个人贷款，当时的贷款使用公司股份抵押的，而当时的股份估值是很高的，贷款到9月底就已经到期了，股份的估值又到了水下，Neumann技术上已经违约了，JP给他45天去找钱… 跟5周前相比，估值少了400亿，当时JP和高盛作为主承销商，跟公司管理层说，IPO可以融资200亿… </p>
<p>注资协议的截止期到2020年4月1日，截止期已过，软银并没有按约定向WeWork的投资人和员工购买30亿美元的股份。软银称此举只是股东层面的交易，并不影响WeWork的公司运作，从2019年10月开始，软银已经完成了50亿的注资。没有购买的股份的原因是公司没有说清楚与股东（尤其是Neumann）的关联交易，进而牵涉司法部和证监会的刑事和民事调查。</p>
<p>因为新冠肺炎的影响，共享办公室没人用了，WeWork开始拖延支付租金… </p>
<p>之前的故事，可以看2019年有人写的一篇：</p>
<p>WeWork 的兴衰和创投的游戏</p>
<p>前段时间的一个大新闻是估值最高的创业公司之一 WeWork 上市失败被投资人软银接盘控股，CEO Adam Neumann 离开。软银接盘 WeWork 并购买 Neumann 手中的股份时以 50 亿美元计算公司的估值，而 1 月软银最近一轮投资时给出的估值是 470 亿美元，也就是说这家公司在几个月时间里估值降到了上一轮融资的 17%，也相当于四年前估值的一半。就在几个月前纽交所的主席和纳斯达克的 CEO 还上门拜访了 Neumann，他们都想争取让 WeWork 在自己的交易所上市。Neumann 向他们提出希望在交易所的餐厅禁用塑料杯和禁食肉类。纳斯达克甚至许诺为致力可持续发展的公司建立一个以 WeWork 命名的「We 50」指数。</p>
<p>这件事无论是看公司/创始人还是看投资人都有很多戏剧性的成分。</p>
<p>WeWork 的外部危机始于它提交的上市文件。这份文件公开的信息让很多投资人对 WeWork 的高额亏损开始担忧，并且很多关键信息没有清楚披露，使得媒体开始挖掘一些问题。首先是 WeWork 和创始人 Neumann 之间有大量的自我交易和利益冲突。比如 Neumann 先注册了 We 的商标，然后以 600 万美元卖给公司；他从公司直接借款或者用公司股份担保贷款数亿美元用于购买房产，再出租给 WeWork 作为办公场所；他提前行权用的 3 亿多美元也是从公司借的，也就是说用公司的钱给自己买了更多股份。Neumann 的很多亲戚都在公司担任高管，包括他妻子以及他们的表兄弟。WeWork 一向把自己的品牌和可持续发展、对环境友好联系在一起，所以她妻子作为首席品牌官坚持他们在上市过程中提交的文件都必须用再生纸打印，然而她对打印效果吹毛求疵，不断要求重新打印，浪费了大量纸张，以至于他们的打印服务商都拒绝合作，让他们另请高明。WeWork 在准备上市文件的时候，Neumann 在马尔代夫度假，因为不想中断度假，他让遇到问题的下属到马尔代夫见他。</p>
<p>New York 杂志的一篇长文里有一段对 Neumann 第一次见孙正义的描述。孙正义在 WeWork 总部见到 Neumann，说他只有 12 分钟参观公司。之后他邀请 Neumann 一起坐到他的车里，在 iPad 上给出了 44 亿美元的投资框架。孙正义让 Neumann 把 WeWork 做到他原计划的 10 倍大，并且告诉他要学习一点人生经验「疯狂比聪明更重要，WeWork 还不够疯狂」。他认为 WeWork 能值数千亿美元。Neumann 因为疯狂而得到了丰厚回报，后来确实越来越疯狂了，但很显然孙正义没有得到他想要的结果。</p>
<p>Neumann 离开 WeWork 时，员工的期权一文不值，软银却为购买股份支付了他十亿美元，并另外提供了他个人 5 亿美元贷款。一位接受媒体采访的 WeWork 员工说「一家以 We 命名的公司却是一个人获取了巨大利益，真是讽刺」。</p>
<p>Matt Levin 在 Bloomberg 的专栏发表的文章里说：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>他一把火烧掉了软银的 100 亿美元，然后还去找他们要了 10% 的佣金。绝对是一个商界传奇。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>软银在这件事中也很有意思。</p>
<p>很多人看了新闻都有一个疑问。在 WeWork 上市失败后软银拿出了 95 亿美元救急（包括购买股份和贷款），加上之前已经投的钱一共有将近 200 亿美元。而如果这家公司现在只值 50 亿美元，为什么不及时止损，而把更多的钱投进去呢？WeWork IPO 出现问题的时候，软银的第二期 vision fund 正在募资，孙正义正在中东和沙特王子们开会让他们投钱，这大概是主要原因之一吧。毕竟 WeWork (曾）是第一期 vision fund 的明星项目，要是这个时候清算了，实在是太难看，留有希望总是好的。有趣的一个细节是，软银特别声明虽然再次注资后拥有 WeWork 80% 的部分，但是并不在董事会占多数席位，并不算控制公司，所以 WeWork 并不是软银的子公司。这是通过放弃一部分投票权而避免把 WeWork 有高额亏损的财报合并到软银的财报里，因为 SEC 规定在衡量是否是子公司时看的是是否持有一半以上有投票权的股份。这或许是软银的接盘预算里多了 20 亿美元给其它股东的原因 — 以便让他们配合这样的安排。</p>
<p>在让 Neumann 离开后，软银说要让 WeWork 重新专注于租赁办公场所的核心业务，潜台词是 WeWork 的现状主要是前 CEO 选择了错误的发展路线，不够专注导致的。可是如果软银是把 WeWork 看作一个中端办公场所房东，整个美国二级市场的办公房地产基金市值加起来也只有一千亿美元，即使 WeWork 把它们都兼并了，价值也只是上轮估值的两倍左右，没有投资人会投最高回报率是两倍的项目。但是如果它是「一种意识形态」，「世界上第一个实体社交网络」，「容纳人们工作生活的方方面面」，那么价值简直无可限量，以后得相当于好几个 Facebook，只有这样才支撑得起 470 亿美元的估值。很显然，软银在上一轮投资时是认可 Neumann 所描绘的景愿的。然而，是这样吗？私募基金难道不是应该比二级市场更有耐心和长期眼光的吗，为什么一被二级市场质疑就改弦易辙了呢？事实是软银关心的并不是 Neumann 描绘的美景是否能实现，而是二级市场是否为它买单。</p>
<p>WeWork 的事因为金额巨大，引起很大震动，但它不是偶然的个例。创始人和投资人在其中表现出的特点对这个行业来说是很有代表性的。</p>
<p>我认识的创始人里有的在拿到 A 轮过桥贷款时就开始想办法把钱放到自己口袋里，谁知道他们在拿到投资后会做什么呢，更别说到上市的阶段了。所以你会看到有很多创业者虽然公司没有做得很成功，但是自己已经开始做天使投资了。并不是所有人都靠第一次成功来得到第一桶金，至少不是传统意义上的成功。</p>
<p>和一定数量的 VC 聊过的人大多能感觉到大部分 VC 看企业只看规模和销售额，几乎不在乎利润，尤其是美元基金的投资人，毕竟在美国上市只要有规模，利润不重要。只要能说某某公司在某某行业市场占有率第一，不管亏损多少，总会有足够的人卖单。所以能不断看到快速扩大规模的以价格为核心竞争力的公司，大致的发展道路是融资 → 以补贴和低价吸引用户 → 融更多的钱 → 更多的补贴和更低的价格吸引更多用户。只要能快速扩张，投资人就会愿意投钱进来，一些幸运的公司能把这种模式一直运转到上市后，直到规模扩大到了难以再大，不能完全再靠讲故事，而业务本身又没发生能突然盈利的奇迹时，问题才暴露出来，但入场早的人已经赚得盆满钵满了。如果 Neumann 稍微「正常」一些，上市前没有那么多问题暴露出来，WeWork 成功上市了，那么一年后被套牢的就是公开市场的股民，不是软银了。这种类型的公司在遇到质疑时最喜欢自比亚马逊，喜欢说你们看亚马逊也是到多少年后才盈利。亚马逊这类公司是在盈利和更快地发展之间做选择，另一类公司是没有选择。大部分公司属于后者。</p>
<p>华尔街日报的文章里有个图比较了几家近几年高调上市的独角兽上市后的股价，趋势一目了然。中国几家这两三年在美国上市的公司的情况我也好奇看了一下，不过就不好意思指名道姓了，反正股价和财报都是公开的，有兴趣的人可以自己去了解。</p>
<p>我自己在互联网行业多年的体会是，这个行业进入成熟的阶段后也快速地世俗化，早期的创新精神和理想主义渐渐被机械和无情的商业机器所替代。过去几年出现了一大批职业创业者，有的人几乎每年做一个新创业项目，从移动应用到区块链，到电子烟，什么概念火就做什么。而资方也形成了成熟的产业链，FA 关心的是把项目推介给资方拿佣金；天使投资人关心的是在 A 轮、B 轮卖给基金；C 轮后的基金和投行关心的是如何让二级市场的股民去接盘。创业者和投资人之间对各自的小算盘其实都很清楚，但毕竟总的来说是在合谋一件事，所以只要没大的冲突也都心照不宣。这个产业链就像一个大机器，不断把社会财富吸收到少数人手里。</p>

            <p>上半年Facebook要推电子货币Libra，带着加密货币又涨了一波，8月份央行就提出要推自己的数字货币DCEP（digital currency electronic payment），央行支付结算司副司长穆长春还在得到上做了个课程《科技金融前沿：Libra与数字货币展望》，解释了数字货币的定位和与当下电子支付的差异，以及与加密货币的区别。</p>
<ol>
<li>定位：<br> 基础货币M0，等同于硬币和纸币这样的法定货币，是央行负债，且是匿名的，同时提高了便携性。</li>
<li>发行方式：<br> 商业银行及其他运营机构（比如支付宝和财付通）向央行全额缴纳准备金，从央行兑换数字货币，然后将数字货币兑换给公众。<br> 与现金不同，数字货币转移必须通过账户，交易数据对第三方匿名，仅对央行这一第三方披露。</li>
<li>技术路线：<br> 央行并没有要求技术路线，运营机构可以采用自己认为适合的技术，包括区块链，但是区块链技术无法应付高并发的零售业务（每秒交易笔数至少达到30万笔），被认为并无竞争优势，但是可能会有其他技术出现，由市场竞争决定。</li>
<li>交易限制<br> 对账户分级别设定交易限额和余额限制，比如用手机号码注册钱包，只能满足日常小额支付需求，如果上传了身份证或者银行卡，就能获得更高级别的数字钱包，如果能前往柜台免签，可能可以无限额；<br> 对数字货币的兑换实行分级收费，对小额、低频的兑换可不收费，对大额、高频兑换和交易收取较高的费用。<br> 很明显，数字货币的目标使用场景是小额零售业务，所以会对大额交易有所限制。</li>
<li>与其他电子支付方式和信用卡支付的区别：<br> 现在主要的电子支付方式是支付宝、财付通和云闪付，已经都要求备付金100%央行存管，安全性和交易方式与数字货币是一致的。区别只是在使用上：<ul>
<li>只要可以进行电子化交易的商户，必须接受数字货币，而其他方式（支付宝等）都是可选的；</li>
<li>能够双离线交易，即收付款方均离线的情况下，也能实现交易，比如在飞机上，或者没有网络的地区。目前支付宝只能实现用户离线支付，双离线使得数字货币比第三方支付更接近于现金。</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>对市场的影响：</p>
<p>券商的报告都认为是新增了一个支付媒介，在发行、兑换、支付、流通等环节会有新的IT需求，对银行的IT服务公司和支付机具公司利好。不太认同，因为现在第三方支付公司都在铺地面机具，即使没有机具，也有二维码收款的小摊贩，只要有手机就能交易，银行会有新的业务线，但是也不复杂，毕竟类似于现金业务，且还不用柜员。</p>
<p>我认为影响在于打通了阿里和腾讯两家垄断的线上支付，有的地方只能用支付宝，有的地方只能用微信，以后只要能用电子支付，就必须接受数字货币，那何必还要分别存财付通和支付宝干嘛呢，淘宝会开支付接口，微信红包也能用数字货币。对于用户行为的画像，又少了很大的一块。对银行可能会有好处，毕竟第三方支付被削弱了，但是谁能抓住机会，还是要看。</p>

            <p><em>Activism is transforming Japan — so long an afterthought for global investors — and forcing some sections of its risk-averse corporate world to overhaul their views on the role of shareholder capitalism.</em></p>
<p><em>Financial Time - Feb 4, 2020</em></p>
<p><img src="https://t1.picb.cc/uploads/2020/02/06/kWBC67.png" alt="Tokyo Tower: foreign activist investors are flocking to Japan’s capital in an effort, they say, to unlock the value of some of the country’s leading companies"></p>
<p>For decades, Tokyo Dome has been a centre piece of the Japanese capital: the world’s largest covered baseball stadium is home to the country’s biggest team. The site boasts a theme park, a 1,000-room hotel and the world’s first spoke-free Ferris wheel. Its revenues have been tepid and its share price flat for six years. Yet no one seemed to mind. </p>
<p>But last Friday, management of the 84-year-old stadium operator woke to find that Oasis Management, its second-largest shareholder, had almost doubled its stake to 9.6 per cent, and that it really does care about Tokyo Dome’s sluggish performance. A pugnacious activist investor which has taken on Nintendo, Panasonic and Toshiba in the past, it issued a fabulously detailed 85-page presentation covering everything from the beer service in the stadium to the state of the hotel curtains — and urged a series of changes that would, says Oasis, unlock vast profit potential.</p>
<p>Tokyo Dome’s management may feel under siege, but after a record year for activist campaigns in Japan, it is not alone. From DIY centers to TV broadcasters and blue-chip tech giants to robot makers, crematoriums and producers of fire hoses, companies are being forced to publicly engage with activists at a frequency and intensity Japan has never seen before.</p>
<p>Controversial tactics including campaigns aimed at shaming companies into action are being deployed by seasoned global activists like Elliott Management and Third Point. Hostile takeover bids are on the rise. An even greater number of confrontations, say advisers, are happening behind closed doors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘The influence of Japanese banks over corporations is waning. Equity investors are becoming more influential’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a market where about half of the 3,700 listed companies are trading below book value, activists see many more opportunities.</p>
<p>Global activist funds, emboldened by state-backed progress on corporate governance, a mounting pile of scalps and record years of share buybacks, have made the Tokyo stock market, for the first time, their highest priority outside the US, according to Lazard research.</p>
<p>The London Stock Exchange’s first initial public offering of 2020 will be the Nippon Active Value Fund — a £200m bellwether for the effectiveness of activism in Japan.</p>
<p>“In a world of historically low interest rates there are few developed places that feature equities trading far below their intrinsic values,” says US investor James Rosenwald, who will oversee the fund.</p>
<p>Activism has transformed the Japanese market into one of its more potentially lucrative stories. And that has put scores of companies on notice. When US fund Third Point targeted Sony last year, demanding it focus on being an entertainment powerhouse, the pressure was such that the Japanese company’s chief executive, Kenichiro Yoshida, penned a seven-page letter explaining why the group would not spin off what Third Point founder Dan Loeb called its “crown jewel” image sensor business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Robot wars: Toshiba Machine v Murakami funds</strong><br>In January, a group of funds tied to Yoshiaki Murakami, Japan’s most famous activist, launched a hostile takeover bid for a former Toshiba subsidiary. The battle stems from Toshiba Machine’s decision to sell its stake in NuFlare to Toshiba — once its parent company — despite the fact that Hoya made a higher offer. Toshiba Machine says it may trigger emergency anti-takeover measures to block the unsolicited ¥25.9bn bid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last year Jamie Dimon, chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, appeared to call time on the priority of maximizing shareholder profits, declaring the need to give equal weight to issues like the environment and workers’ rights.</p>
<p>Yet in Japan, 2019 was the year the corporate world finally woke up to the importance of shareholders. “We think that activism is going to increase in Japan because you are looking at a shareholder base that is more global and taking a more global approach,” says Rich Thomas, who leads Lazard’s shareholder activism practice outside the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>19</strong><br>Formally launched activist campaigns in 2019, almost 5 times the tally four years earlier.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="Record-breaking-year"><a href="#Record-breaking-year" class="headerlink" title="Record breaking year"></a>Record breaking year</h2><p>There were 75 activist “events” — defined as formal demands on managements by shareholders — in Japan last year, with $4.5bn in capital deployed. The 19 formally launched activist campaigns in 2019 were almost five times the tally four years earlier.</p>
<p>The quantitative change is important, say activists and the companies facing them down, but last year also saw the start of a clear qualitative change. In the first phase of activism’s rise in Japan, between 2015 and 2018, the campaigns were quite narrow in their ambitions. They would concentrate on hoarders of cash, hoarders of other companies’ stock or generally flabby balance sheets and would mostly demand share buy- backs and raised dividends.</p>
<p>These campaigns are now increasingly focused on the kind of big strategic changes that, they argue, could permanently unlock value.</p>
<p>Zuhair Khan, a senior portfolio manager at Union Bancaire Privée in Tokyo, says there has been a gradual improvement in governance at many Japanese companies. A 2015 code has given investors a state-endorsed language to argue for improvements and forced company managements to accept that outsiders matter, says Mr Khan.</p>
<p>There has also been a realization among investors of the potency of their votes, which could in theory oust the entire board of a Japanese company at an AGM or force an extraordinary shareholder meeting — the most feared scenario for any chief executive who does not want to be humiliated in front of investors.</p>
<p>The power of the EGM was illustrated last year when a boardroom crisis at Lixil, a home fittings company, forced shareholders to vote between competing slates of board nominees. After the abrupt ousting of its chief executive, Kinya Seto, a group of long-term Japanese and foreign investors demanded the removal of his successor through an EGM. Mr Seto was eventually restored to his position after shareholders backed his proposal for a new board.</p>
<p>This example reflects a permanent shift in the balance of power, says Mr Khan. “Lixil sent a message that managements have to court shareholders for their vote. It used to be about shareholders saying, ‘Please give us more access’. The environment has changed. Increasingly companies [are] chasing the shareholders.”</p>
<p>Equally important has been a sharp rise in hostile takeover bids — an extreme rarity in Japan just a year ago.</p>
<p>The increase in both accountability and hostile takeovers has been influenced by the 2014 introduction of a stewardship code that compels Japan’s biggest institutions from pension funds to banks and insurance groups to approach activism and hostile bids as investors with fiduciary duties rather than as cosy old friends of the companies whose stocks they hold.</p>
<p>“Japanese companies are starting to realize that hostile or unsolicited takeovers can often unlock value, and that is why it is becoming an option even for blue-chip companies,” says Kunihiro Mita, chief executive of Mita Securities, a midsized brokerage near the Tokyo Stock Exchange which has made its name in hostile bids in recent years.</p>
<p>“Activists are becoming more sophisticated and their proposals are also becoming more rational so companies need to engage with them even if they don’t want to,” Mr Mita adds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Beer battle: Kirin v FP</strong><br>UK-based Franchise Partners launched a campaign late last year to persuade the Japanese brewer to focus on making beer instead of forays into biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Instead of seeking buybacks or raised dividends, FP pushed for wholesale strategic change. Kirin’s recent shift to the healthcare and pharmaceuticals business follows a pattern of Japanese groups diversifying to offset a chronic decline in the domestic beer market, which peaked 25 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Curtailing-a-cosy-relationship"><a href="#Curtailing-a-cosy-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Curtailing a cosy relationship"></a>Curtailing a cosy relationship</h2><p>This remaking of Japan Inc rests on a critical structural shift: the changing role of banks. In the postwar period, conglomerates including Toyota and Toshiba expanded on the back of lending from banks, which in turn bought shares in their clients and dispatched executives to join their boards.</p>
<p>Those dynamics have changed drastically, with the advent of negative interest rates and high liquidity where companies can easily turn to equity and bond markets to raise money. The governance push under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also created strong pressures for banks to unwind their cross-shareholdings, and for companies to disclose and explain their strategic stockholdings.</p>
<p>“The influence of Japanese banks over corporations is waning,” says Haruo Nakamura, deputy president and head of investment banking at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “Equity investors are becoming more influential . . . but Japanese management are not deeply familiar with how they should manage [their] companies to align the interest of equity investors. That’s the challenge they face.”</p>
<p>Critics argue that old loyalties have in the past allowed complacency. Higher governance standards increasingly mean that those firms with an inefficient balance sheet are being punished with lower share prices and face becoming targets for activists.</p>
<p>In the past two years shares in Tokyo Broadcasting System have fallen 27 per cent and the company has been on the receiving end of two separate investor campaigns, each calling on the media group to offload noncore holdings to improve returns for shareholders.</p>
<p>“If you are going to be part of this whole corporate governance movement, you can’t really ignore companies like TBS. It’s such an egregious abuser of balance sheet,” says Joe Bauernfreund, chief executive of Asset Value Investors, which in 2018 called on TBS to sell its large stake in chipmaker Tokyo Electron. The proposal was rejected, but TBS did subsequently sell some shares in Tokyo Electron, leaving investors critical of the pace of its move.</p>
<p>Mr Bauernfreund — whose UK-based fund has $505m invested in 30 Japanese companies — says sometimes the intention is to spark a reaction. “We’re not coming in and asking for radical changes. But if we can ask [companies] to take steps in the right direction and they benefit from a rising share price on the back of that, perhaps that encourages them to do more,” he says.</p>
<p>Companies’ reaction to activism has moved on from the blind panic of a decade ago. Many are pragmatic enough to engage. Bankers say company managements are becoming more attuned to shareholder complaints. In Sony’s case, the demand from Third Point was a popular one for sprawling Japanese groups: to simplify its business line-up so investors can better value the company.</p>
<p>“We never thought the proposal [to offload the image sensor business] was strange,” says Sony’s Mr Yoshida, noting that the likes of Toshiba and IBM had taken similar steps. “It’s a question we need to ask ourselves all the time.”</p>
<p>While rejecting Third Point’s main proposal, Sony did subsequently sell its stake in medical-equipment maker Olympus and pulled the plug on its struggling PlayStation Vue video streaming service. Its share price has risen 60 per cent since Third Point’s campaign was revealed in April 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Baseball saga: Tokyo Dome v Oasis Management Oasis</strong><br>last week went public with its criticism of the way Tokyo’s biggest baseball stadium is run. It launched a campaign with detailed analysis of how the company manages its stadium, theme park and hotel and suggests a range of upgrades that, Oasis claims, could almost double net income if implemented in full. Tokyo Dome says it plans to issue a written response to Oasis, now its second-largest shareholder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, pressure from shareholders has given chief executives cover to take painful decisions.</p>
<p>“There are usually no big surprises in letters from shareholders since a CEO knows the business better,” says Yoshinobu Fujimoto, a partner at law firm Nishimura &amp; Asahi, who specializes in shareholder activism. “But the CEO can sometimes use the letter from a share- holder as an excuse to make a difficult business decision.”</p>
<h2 id="‘Poison-pill’-defense"><a href="#‘Poison-pill’-defense" class="headerlink" title="‘Poison pill’ defense"></a>‘Poison pill’ defense</h2><p>There are, however, signs of a growing backlash from some companies. To thwart an approach from Japan’s most famous family of shareholder activists, the Murakamis, Toshiba Machine is try- ing to resurrect a “poison pill” defense — a legal mechanism used by boards to fend off an unwanted takeover bid. It has led some to fear that other companies will be dusting off their poison pill plans.</p>
<p>“Despite a recent decline in poison pill measures, there is concern that one major hostile incident would trigger an extreme reaction,” says Takeyuki Ishida, head of Japanese research at ISS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Activism is going to increase in Japan because you are looking at a shareholder base that is more global’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another concern for investors is an amendment to the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trading Act — the final details of which have yet to be announced — that would control overseas investments into companies whose operations are deemed to have a national security dimension. To qualify for exemptions from what critics have dubbed an “anti-activist bill”, foreign investors must agree not to propose the sale or transfer of business units at shareholder meetings, or place their own or related people on company boards — things that are bread and butter to activist investors.</p>
<p>Others worry that the governance revolution will simply run out of steam — it is now less visibly backed by Mr Abe as his focus has turned to other issues in what may be his final year in power.</p>
<p>Despite all the progress, says UBP’s Mr Khan, about 30 per cent of Topix 500 companies have not adapted to the new environment at all. “They are acting as if nothing has changed,” he says. “They have high cross-shareholdings and entrenched management. In my view they are uninvestable.”</p>
<p>But Seth Fischer, chief investment officer at Oasis and architect of the campaign against Tokyo Dome, says the window is still wide open. “Japan is going through a rapidly accelerating transition towards becoming a dramatically more shareholder-friendly investment universe. It’s the exact opposite of the discussion in the US with Jamie Dimon.”</p>

            <p><em>Having underperformed their benchmarks and lost the faith of investors, many fund managers are looking to boost returns by making use of big data and machine learning. Will it be an expensive dead end?</em></p>
<p><em>Financial Time - Feb 12, 2020</em></p>
<p>On the last Sunday of April 2019, a sleek Gulfstream V jet belonging to Occidental Petroleum touched down at Omaha airport. The oil company had sent a delegation to Nebraska for a secret meeting with Warren Buffett, hoping to persuade Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman to come to their rescue in their battle for Anadarko.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the meeting did not stay secret for long. An “alternative data” company called Quandl which tracks the flight details of private jets had quickly alerted its clients — mostly hedge funds — of the Gulfstream V’s unexpected visit and the potential trading opportunity. Two days later, Occidental announced a $10bn investment from the Oracle of Omaha. </p>
<p>The episode is emblematic of how the beleaguered industry of stockpickers is trying to recapture its edge at a time when many have failed to meet their benchmarks and have lost the faith of investors. A large number of traditional hedge funds and mutual fund groups have watched assets flow out either into passive funds or into computer-driven “quantitative” investment strategies. </p>
<p>In a bid to restore their prowess, they are turning to some of the data-mining techniques pioneered by their “quant” rivals and are investing heavily in programmers and data scientists. They are hoping that a hybrid approach — combining the judgment of an experienced stockpicker with insights from big data — will give them a new lease of life. </p>
<p>“For three decades the hedge fund industry largely took two different paths, fundamental and quantitative, and the two never really crossed,” says Matthew Granade, a senior executive at Point72, a large US hedge fund. “Now we’re seeing the two paths slowly coming together.” </p>
<p>Investors have always been adept at using new technologies to gain an advantage. Venetian traders would use telescopes to inspect the flags of incoming ships, deriving clues on their cargo to buy and sell commodities accordingly. As Jack Treynor, former editor of the CFA Institute’s Financial Analysts Journal, once observed: “You may not get rich by using all the available information, but you surely will become poor if you don’t.” </p>
<p>The investment industry’s information war has been supercharged by the era of big data and artificial intelligence. Merging old-school fundamental and cutting-edge quantitative investing — often given the awkward portmanteau “quantamental” — is one of the most powerful trends in asset management. </p>
<p>Take Lee Ainslie’s Maverick Capital. Mr Ainslie split from Julian Robertson’s hedge fund Tiger Management in 1993, going on to forge a name as one of the industry’s top stockpickers. Maverick did not hire its first quantitative analyst until 2006, and Mr Ainslie admits he was initially somewhat sceptical. </p>
<p>“It was an experiment. I thought the effort might end up being a waste of time and money, but I also thought it could make us better investors,” he says. “Today quant plays a role in virtually every part of our investment process. It has helped us be better prepared for a much tougher environment.” </p>
<p>However, integrating the two approaches is often difficult in practice. Some money managers admit that results have so far been patchy, bemoan the cost of sought-after technology staff and new data sets, and quietly wonder whether it is a waste of time and cash. </p>
<p>While almost everyone in the industry expects asset management to rely more on quantitative techniques in the future, many question whether it will end up as a material advantage for stockpickers or an expensive dead end. </p>

<p>‘Investors are fed up. The long-short community hasn’t delivered on its promise of equity-like returns with less risk over the past decade’</p>

<h2 id="Knowledge-exchange"><a href="#Knowledge-exchange" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge exchange"></a>Knowledge exchange</h2><p>For over two decades the Georgian town houses of Mayfair were home to GLG Partners. Founded by three former Goldman Sachs bankers in the mid-1990s hedge fund heyday, GLG quickly became a prominent member of the wealthy London district’s financial community, where its traders could scour markets for opportunities by day and hobnob with clients at Michelin-starred restaurants by night. </p>
<p>But two years ago it finally moved into the headquarters of its parent Man Group, the gleaming modernist Riverbank House overlooking the Thames. Man, which bought GLG in 2010, was under pressure to cut costs, but executives say the main impetus was to mesh GLG’s traditional “discretionary” traders with its computer-powered quant arm AHL — hoping that the combination would prove greater than its parts. </p>
<p>Today, GLG and AHL’s portfolio managers, traders, researchers and executives all sit together on the sixth floor, which has helped the cross-pollination of expertise, according to Paul Chambers, formerly head of equities at Man AHL and now head of quantitative research at Man GLG. “It’s easier to meet and exchange information when you walk past your colleagues in the corridor,” he says. </p>
<p>The cohabitation of GLG’s old-school traders and fund managers with AHL’s programmers and data scientists is an apt manifestation of a trend taking place across the investment industry. </p>
<p>Many traditional hedge and mutual fund groups aim to curb outflows and ameliorate pressures on fees, and hope that programmers and data scientists can help. </p>
<p>“I wholeheartedly believe that discretionary investing will continue to thrive, as there are many things that humans are much better at than machines,” says Teun Johnston, Man GLG chief executive. “But I believe that quantamental investing will grow, and my job running a discretionary business is to ensure that it continues to thrive.” </p>
<p>What the quantamental approach means in practice varies greatly. It can range from automating back-office aspects such as record-keeping and compliance, improving risk management tools and portfolio analysis, to overhauling trading and research. Once recondite fields of computer science, such as natural language processing — teaching computers to understand and analyse text and human speech — and machine learning are now buzzwords across the industry. </p>
<p>“A profound shift is under way among investors,” Vishwanath Tirupattur, global head of quantitative research at Morgan Stanley, said in a report titled “Quant Ain’t Just for Quants Anymore”. </p>
<p>“The significance of quant in our clients’ investment process is clearly on the rise,” he wrote. “Increasingly, they are applying sophisticated quantitative techniques in investment analysis.” </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley polled 400 big investment clients late last year, and 51 per cent said machine learning — a field of artificial intelligence used to parse huge data sets — was either a component of or central to their investing process, up from 27 per cent in 2016. Only 13 percent said machine learning is not being investigated, down from 44 per cent three years earlier. </p>

<h2 id="Navigating-an-‘ocean’-of-data"><a href="#Navigating-an-‘ocean’-of-data" class="headerlink" title="Navigating an ‘ocean’ of data"></a>Navigating an ‘ocean’ of data</h2><p>The main impetus comes from a poor stretch for returns that has tested investor faith. Only 12 per cent of US equity mutual funds have surpassed their benchmarks over the past decade, according to S&amp;P. Even high-flying hedge funds have been brought down to earth, especially the classic long-short hedge fund, which bets on stocks both falling and rising. </p>
<p>“Investors are understandably fed up,” Mr Ainslie says. “The long-short community hasn’t delivered on its promise of equity-like returns with less risk over the past decade.” </p>
<p>The most excitement surrounds the integration of “alternative data” into the investment process. This can range from scraping the internet for product reviews, social media chatter and web traffic, to churning through credit card purchase data, digital shipping records, email purchase receipts and even mobile phone locations. </p>
<p>“Data is a big disrupter,” says Ravit Mandell, who leads a new data unit at JPMorgan’s $1.9tn asset management arm. “Storage and computing power are really cheap now. So why not try to collect all the information available in all languages from around the world?” </p>
<p>For example, JPMorgan Asset Management has created what it calls a natural language-processing dashboard. This continuously crunches information from millions of sources ranging from investment bank research, social media, earnings call transcripts, online job boards, news stories and regulatory filings and delivers it to fund managers at a touch of their keyboards. </p>
<p>Integrating quants and alternative data fully into a fund manager’s research and investment process — but without trying to turn them into quants themselves — is crucial, says Man GLG’s Mr Chambers. “Realistically, no discretionary manager wants to help a quant automate them away, and no quant wants to create tools that no one uses,” he says. </p>
<p>Some investment groups began experimenting with alternative data well over a decade ago, but it is only in recent years that efforts have really taken off. Maverick Capital, for example, ramped up its efforts in 2015, and now has 15 quants and data scientists. Mr Ainslie says the results have only become apparent in the past two years — and the early days of data collection now seem quaint to him. </p>
<p>“We used to hire people just to count cars in parking lots and things like that. In hindsight, it was all ridiculously inconsistent and anecdotal,” Mr Ainslie says. “We’re in an ocean of information and navigating it can be difficult. But our experience as fundamental investors has really helped us to focus on the right things.” </p>
<p>However, some money managers privately say they have been left disappointed by the pay-off from their investments in highly paid programmers and expensive alternative data. Even when they do discover something they can exploit, the profitability is quickly eroded by other funds pouncing. </p>
<p>“Everyone knows these data sets exist. The challenge is taking it and creating a meaningful signal,” JPMorgan’s Ms Mandell says. </p>
<p>Data on credit card purchases, for example, have now become such a commodity that some say there is little value left to extract. Other data sets, such as satellite imagery and geolocation data from smartphones, are promising but expensive, often hard in practice to turn into actionable, profitable trades — and come with privacy concerns that deter some investors. The data can be only occasionally useful — such as the private jet data that revealed Occidental’s stealthy Omaha visit. </p>
<p>Even Tammer Kamel, the head of Nasdaq-owned Quandl, which supplied that information, warns that there may be too much hype surrounding alternative data. “It’s powerful, but it’s not as easy as people initially think it is,” he says. “There are a few dozen firms that are having real and sustainable success with alternative data. But I don’t think the club is expanding very quickly.” </p>
<p>The biggest hurdle is the resistance of many traditional fund managers to learning new tricks and tools, according to Point72’s Mr Granade. “It’s much harder to do than most people realise, mostly for cultural reasons. Producing insight from data isn’t easy but the biggest challenge is figuring out how to drive collaboration and understanding between portfolio managers and data scientists.” </p>
<p>Institutional investors are keen on the trend but one admits that it is often hard to determine who has actually managed the feat of melding quant techniques with traditional investing. “If you don’t use data science and quants you’ll struggle. But how much is real, and how much is marketing?” he asks. </p>

<h2 id="Extracting-real-value"><a href="#Extracting-real-value" class="headerlink" title="Extracting real value"></a>Extracting real value</h2><p>There remain many pitfalls. Two years ago, Mr Ainslie wrote a letter to his investors suggesting that Maverick had finally “cracked the code” in integrating alternative data with its traditional investment approach. But almost immediately after he sent the letter, the hedge fund suffered a poor bout of performance, he admits. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, while the letter was “probably premature”, Mr Ainslie still reckons that it represented an inflection point for the $9bn hedge fund. “It’s in the last two years that we’ve really started to see the benefits of alternative data,” he says. “The number of data sets is exploding, and we believe our ability to extract value from them is improving every day.” </p>
<p>More recent results seem to bear out his optimism. Maverick’s flagship fund notched up a 17.2 per cent return last year, compared with 11 per cent for the average long-short hedge fund. A leveraged version of the same fund gained 33.2 per cent, and the “Maverick Long Enhanced” fund clocked 45.6 per cent. </p>
<p>Mr Ainslie remains optimistic that Maverick — and the industry as a whole — will eventually see the benefits of a hybrid approach. Investors who do not combine fundamental and quantitative analysis will perish, he says. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing some benefits, but we’re still in the early innings,” he adds. “While I don’t think we’re going to read that Warren Buffett has hired a quant team tomorrow, in the future if a fundamental investor doesn’t develop such capabilities I believe they will be at a competitive disadvantage.” </p>
